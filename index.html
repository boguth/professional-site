      My name is Bo.  I'm a software developer who trained at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" alt="Software Development Training School">Dev Bootcamp</a> in Chicago.There, I learned Ruby on Rails along with the full web development stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in the world of software development and coding started several years ago when, out of curiosity, I began exploring what this whole coding thing was about. I learned HTML & CSS, and picked up bits of pieces of JavaScript and PHP. This knowledge helped me get a job as a digital strategist and SEO specialist at a <a href="ccgideas.com">marketing firm</a> in Birmingham, Alabama.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had caught the coding bug, and the desire to delve deeper into the world of software development eventually led me to apply to DBC in Chicago. The experience was life changing. Through the process of learning the fundamentals of software development - exploring the intricacies of Ruby on Rails and the web stack - I also discovered within myself a passion for coding that I didn't know I could feel. More specifically, I found that the combination of creativity and practical knowledge required to design and implement exemplary and fully functional software appealed to my sense of creativty, as well as my innate curiosity and perserverence in pursuit of solutions to a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary goal is to use my skills in software development to to create something fundamentally good, in the broadest sense of the word. I want to work on something that is both useful and beneficial to people or the world around me. I am interested in working on web applications as well as smart phone applications and I would like to work with a group of people who share my values of honesty, kindness, and intellectual curiosity.
